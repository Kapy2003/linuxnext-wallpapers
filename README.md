This is some of my wallpapers that a decent amount of people continue to ask in the youtube comments on linuxnext, so here they are :)

i do not own or create these wallpapers

i get them from wallhaven with the use of wallpaper-selector

some of these wallpapers are from a artist i know on x/twitter called paji
https://x.com/artpaji

i also use upscaler to upscale the images to make them look more higher quality :P
