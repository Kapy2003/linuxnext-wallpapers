These are some of my wallpapers that i have, a decent amount of people continue to ask in the youtube comments on linuxnext, so here they are.

I do not own this art and use it only for wallpapers on my desktop.

I get them from wallhaven with the use of wallpaper-selector.

Some of these wallpapers are from a artist i know on x/twitter like paji.

If you like his work, consider buying his art :)

I also use upscaler to upscale the images to make them look more higher quality :P

If you are reading this and your art is in this repo, consider telling me so i can either remove it or give credit to you in this description.
